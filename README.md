# typeRacerScript
only for education, do not use this code for ranking competition!  

## How to use  
Again, this is just for fun, not for cheating or ranking. Please be fair.  
### easy way 
1. Copy the script.  
2. And open site where you want to run this script, for example open type racer site and start a new race.  
3. Right-click anywhere and choose Inspect (or press F12) to open Developer Tools.
4. Go to the Console tab. Paste the script there and press Enter.  
Now check if code is working.  
## If code is not working:
1. The page is fully loaded.
2. The site didn't update its structure (in that case the script may need update).
3. Console is allowed to run JS code on the page.
